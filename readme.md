# ECOMVISION

ECOMVISION is an admin dashboard used to keep track of products, customers, transactions and statistics associated with your application.

It was built using the MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS (MERN) stack with the help of react redux

It uses nivo charts to help display stats and has a lovely theme with the help of Material UI

The design and implementation of this website was inspired by "Build a MERN React Admin Dashboard | Redux Toolkit Query, Backend Focus, Deployment, Data Modeling" course by ❤️EdRoh❤️

You may face some latency due to not using aggregate api calls in this app
